### Flash updates
- Anouk:
    - The dynamic global CESM-LME fully forced simulation are done. Both the global single and fully forced last millennium SMB simulations with a fixed geometry are also done. (All exclude for now the Antarctic glaciers, because CRU was used as a base line climate.) The next step will be to repeat the single forced SMB simulations with a prescribed geometry that is based on the fully forced simulations.
- Larissa:
     - Fixed geometry runs for all regions are running. Results for Iceland look promising. Question of ensemble mean forcing/ mean of ensemble results. If ensemble mean forcing: downscaling method? 
- Hamid:
     - Thinking about how to use the multi-temporal glacier outlines (PROTECT project)in OGGM (e.g. model calibration / validation).
- Sarah:
    - try to implement "run_with_hydro" funciton on monthly basis some weeks ago, didn't work so easily, Fabien had a try on it, I looked at his implementation, doesn't quite seem to work yet (lot of nan values?)
- Jan:
    - Worked (probably too much...) on frontal velocities
    - Now starting to work on EGU presentation
- Fabien:
    - Monthly stuff looks ok (https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/pull/1232)
    - https://www.earthcube.org/2021-earthcube-annual-meeting will send an abstract
    
- Lilian:
    - what is the influence of geodetic uncertainties versus equifinality on volume projection uncertainties
    - meeting with Romain Hugonnet about geodetic data
        - I will have to implement a method to aggregate individual glacier uncertainties to regional uncertainties (using variograms)
    - working on EGU pico and additional material

### Flash updates
- Anouk:
    - I made a little change in the mass balance bias calibration of the subregions for my millenium long runs (not only excluding the tidewater glaciers, but now also the ice caps for the calibration procedure). The dynamic fully forced simulations are almost ready. I plan to start the SMB simulations today.
- Larissa:
    - Finished and applied the new delta method using CMIP6 decadal and historical simulations, quite happy with results using them in SMB simulations. Considering the usefulness of using an initialized (Eis et al (2021)) dynamical model.
- Bea: 
    - Quick feedback on vEGUPICO presentation material. On holidays under lockdown so plenty of time to catch up with the OGGM team
- Nicolas:
    - project GRUE (crane in English I guess) using OGGM-edu for teaching kids and municipalies 
- Forrest:
    - Still calibrating OGGM for tropical Andes. Now have annual glacier outlines 1984-2020, 12 GPR transects & 32 local DEMs for geodetic & topo input. 
        - Challenges (Maybe questions for group discussion??):
                - Debris cover?
                - Assigning different MB gradients for accumulation & ablation zones? 
    - excited to use the OGGM browser-based glacier simulator & OGGM-edu for teaching next week 

- Lilian:
    - did projections for Alpine glaciers with ISIMIP3b ssp126 and ssp370 with 200 draws for 6 "mb types", 
    - from where come the volume differences in the draws:
        - I believe mainly from the geodetic uncertainties that I apply
        - how to distinguish between the different uncertainties?
    - are there uncertainties from the Farinotti2019 estimates for each glacier individually? one glen-a for a region or a glen-a for each glacier and draw?
- Fabien:
    - not much news, getting ready for grenoble
    - had a meeting with mitigation paper co-authors yesterday


### Group Agenda Points
- Journal club.

## OGGM-Edu roadmap call: 2019-10-04

- Fabien Maussion / University of Innsbruck 
- Lizz Ultee / MIT
- Zora Schirmeister / University of Innsbruck
- Patrick 
- Daniel

### Updates

- retour Peru workshop Lizz
    - Spanish notebooks: https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia
    - Recommendation for OGGM-Edu: more guidance on OGGM-Edu website on how to start a repo and add helper functions.
- apps Zora:
    - Update on the new glacier explorer app -> made great progress with the new data, but the app needs some re-arrangement in screen
    - The other app needs filling
- apps Patrick
    - showed the app with new tabs serving various purposes (e.g. advanced mode, advanced plots). Main change is the time-series plots (called "logger plots") which are allowing to see changes in volume. The app is great and almost reading to be served. Performance is going to be a key issue for online use.
- retour development process Daniel (last two notebooks) and associated questions
    - three notebooks developped: temperature-index models, mass-balance, glacier advance and retreat
    - noticed difficulties in deciding what to do next, and overlap with OGGM tutorial notebooks 

### Agenda

General discussion about state and fate of OGGM-Edu. Mainly we are happy with the state of the project:
- **the apps** are uncontroversial and can continue development. The technical issue will be how to serve them online. For local application, either an executable or, better, a container based workflow
- there is work to do on the documentation of the project. What do we try to achieve? Who is the main audience? Once we have sorted out these questions the future work is going to be easier.
- we discussed the possibility to simplify the modelling workflow with dedicated, more specialized objects which are easier to work with and build upon. It remains open whether this is a good idea or not... 

### Specific action items 

- use notebook 7 from Lizz' class and translate it back in OGGM-Edu
- continue app development and facilitate deployment (key actor here: Timo + ourselves for the local deploy)
- brainstorm about a new "OGGM-Edu" with simpler objects and simpler workflows

    - finished the equilibrium runs with the VAS model.
    - started to look into linearity of the VAS model.
- Matthias
    - tested a possible precipitation gradient but probably reject the idea
- Matteo:
    - Analyzed the feature importance (i.e. what variables are important)
    - mass-balance above point, slope, are most important to explain thickness
- Anouk:
    - Sensitivity to initial conditions
    - Still in Utrecht 
    - CESM data mess: OGGM doesn't allow for time before Julian day 1. You can create such a climate file. However when using it as forcing you get an error. 
- Timo:
    - Still problems with Bokeh - ended up working without explanation!

### Agenda

- What statistical measures do you use to compare two (or more) time series? In particular comparing observed glacier length change with modeled one. (Matthias)
    - OGGM small funcs in [utils](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/blob/2058f993a56403d14bfba05096c3ca367e395e65/oggm/utils/_funcs.py#L298-L328) can be extended!
    - Idea: moving (rolling) statistics (rmsd / r2 / etc as timeseries)
    - Statistics in atmospheric sciences book
- Question on the flowlines from Jenna 
    - How to start from spin-up: look on the docs and ask on slack
- Discuss the results of the ACF and PSD analysis of the modeled VAS glacier length changes (Moritz).
    - PSD of flowline model shows a low pass behaviour (constant power for frequencies above 0.05/year). PSD of VAS model decreases constantly on the logarithmic scale (energy cascade, low pass filter?)
    - The VAS model shows less auto correlation at shorter lag times (< 200 years) than the flowline model, indicating more high frequency variability.
    - ToDo's: Compute ACF and PSD for climate signal, to better relate the forcing to the output. Additionally, get rid of spinup period for both analysis.
    
- Matteo plots
    - Showed how the volume changes between different training samples: 1% deviation
    - Showed how the score changes with different training samples: weird values for some runs: maybe some glaciers are completly left out?
    - Feature importance seems reasonable.
    - TODOS: 
        - Leave one glacier out from the training sample
        - Check how random is sklearn cross validation to find out how come some scores are much lower
        - Run oggm ice thickness for one glacier and compare it with the machine learning model.
- Anouk plot:
    - nice to see that glaciers end up at the correct volume
    - still questions about why it takes so long to merge together
    - TODO: investigations as to which glaciers are responsible


### Action items

- Rediscuss with Matthias about gradient and re-calibration 
- Long term CESM data on Github (Issue #818)

### Move to next meeting


## 2019-07-24 call

Hello and welcome to the team meeting!

### Flash updates

- Fabien
    - gave a talk at IUGG 2019: https://fabienmaussion.info/2019/07/24/IUGG2019
    - a lot of feedback from the conference: OGGM highly visible, but concrete adoption (i.e. doing stuff with the model or develop) still slow. Hints of change with new users recently
    - Lizz using OGGM-Edu for a 1-week lecture in Peru: https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia. We set-up a dedicated JupyterHub for the class.
- Matteo:
    - Update about running the machine learning model for all the glaciers in the Alps
    - Do you know [nteract Data Explorer](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/packages/data-explorer)
- Julia:
    - Experiments with real world glaciers
    - link to TC discussion: https://www.the-cryosphere-discuss.net/tc-2019-68
- Matthias:
    - PR about merging glacier done: https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/pull/827
- Zora:
    - working with Patrick about the app
    - problems with the Bokeh server on edu.oggm.org: https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-edu/issues/66
    - we need a concept for the bokeh applications in Bremen
- Moritz:
    - Further work on the equilibrium runs, comparing the volume/area scaling model with the flowline mode
    - Made progress about spectral analysis: nice plots

### Agenda

- Format of these calls
    - Fabien explained it but need for some explanation text maybe
- Twitter
- thoughts on a PolynomialProfilemMassBalance model?
    - need for more realisic MB profiles
    - Please open a point on github
    - diverged to having a PeriodicMassBalanceModel
    - diverged to PeriodicMassBalanceScenario
- Need for discussion about Julia's revisions
    - Matthias, Julia and Fabien had a longer conversation about how to deal with the reviews


### Action items

- talk to Timo about bokeh when back from holiday
- Twitter contributor meeting next week
- Preformance problems about Hackmd integration in website: not much we can do here

### Move to next meeting

- Push for JupyterHub in the upcoming cluster in Bremen
- Matteo: discussion about the score
- RGI group

## 2019-07-03 call
