# OGGM Open Meeting 

###### tags: `oggm` `meeting notes`

About the format:
- **Flash updates**: quick round of short updates (~2 minutes), request of additional agenda items for longer discussions
- **Group agenda points**: longer, open discussion points of the day. Could be something that needs input from all participants, a discussion about model choices, or a prepared presentation from one of the members. Note that **our goal is to keep "Flash updates" + "Open agenda" under one hour** in order to keep a dynamic meeting.
- **Specific discussion:** more technical items that may not be of interest to everyone (e.g. about a specific problem, master thesis, etc.). These will take place after the official part.
- **Action items**: what needs to be done after the meeting and by who
- **Move to next meeting**: items that couldn't be discussed this time

# Call: 2021-11-17

### Flash updates
- Anouk: 
    - I have started to use the new flowline diagnostics, so I will be able to prescribe the geometry of the LMR simulations during the simulations forced with the CESM-LME. 
    - I started working on getting the ELA back as diagnostic variable in OGGM. It will become a variable that can seperately be computed (it won't be a standard model run output). 
- Patrick:
    - working on final steps for the release of the new OGGM-Edu App
    - continue connecting COMBINE with OGGM GlacierDirectory
- Lilian:
    - worked last week together with Sarah that she can use the massbalance-sandbox with the hydro-model
    - writing phd concept ...
- Fabien:
    - some changes to OGGM: https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/commits/master
- Samar:
    - Trying to set up an ice sheet model (CISM) for mountain glaciers and GlacierMIP
    - Still trying to finish OGGM work for Karakoram (presenting at AGU)
    - Applying for postdoc positions 

- Lizz:
    - Supporting student working on hydro simulations of Olivares Alfa, Chile

### Group Agenda Points
- Presentations by Jan and Larissa

### Action items
- Presentation by Romain November 17th

### Flash updates
- Anouk:
    - I'm currently working on global simulations over the period 0-2000 CE, forced with the Last Millenium Reanalysis. I'm in the phase of calibrating the simulations. In the end this experiment will serve as base simulation for the mass balance attribution to different climate forcings over the last millenium.
- Jan:
    - Did some calibrated projections w/ and wo/ frontal ablation
    - Can show some plots soon
- Julia:
    - Coming to an end with my digression on carbon-cycle climate modeling 
    --> I would be happy to present some results about it (not OGGM related, but it is the prehistory and closely related to my following work with OGGM)
    - will start global equilibrium runs with OGGM soon
- Larissa:
    - Decision: recalibrating to Hugonnet for 2000 onward decades?
    - Finishing all decades: can show plots next meeting?
- Patrick:
    - Not much new, still working on connecting COMBINE with GlacierDirectories for testing the method on real glaciers
- Lilian:
    - writing PhD concept, but got stuck in details when comparing method implementations between models :-)
- Sarah: 
    - trying to downscale coarse climate data, however it is very slow
- Fabien:
    - did some tests simulations for glacierMIP3
    - new stop criterion for OGGM simulations
    - Geodetic calibration now happening on calendar years (also in the preprocessed directories) and also works on multiple flowlines on demand (not recommended) 
    - As always: recent commits on gitub: https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/commits/master
- Hamid
    - Working on projections with MBdebris (mass balance with debri covers)
- Samar    
    - Doing some runs in Himalaya-Karakoram region with ERA5-L atm data - preparing for AGU FM presentation
- Muhammad 
    - Recently started in Bremen and going to work on Greenland Peripheral glaciers with OGGM.
- Melissa
    - Working on a poster
    - Received comments on the sun changing colors in the graphics

### Group Agenda Points
- Day light saving time will end here on October 31st (read the clock will go 1 hour backwards). If that is not the case where you are, please keep in mind for the next meeting that the time shifts ;) 
- Journal club
- Showing some first results of the LMR simulations
- Velocity
