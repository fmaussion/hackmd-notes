# OGGM Open Meeting 

###### tags: `oggm` `meeting notes`

About the format of our meetings:
- **Flash updates** are a quick round of short updates (~2-3 minutes) by all parcipitants (please also write them in the shared notes). Here you can request for additional agenda items that require longer discussions (example: "I have a problem understanding XY")
- **Group agenda points** are longer, open discussion points of the day. This could be something that needs input from all participants, a discussion about model choices, or a prepared presentation from one of the members. 
- Note that **our goal is to keep "Flash updates" + "Open agenda" under one hour** in order to keep a dynamic meeting.
- **Specific discussion:** more technical items that may not be of interest to everyone (e.g. about a specific problem, master thesis, etc.). These will take place after the official part.
- **Action items**: what needs to be done after the meeting and by who

### Flash updates

- Patrick:
    - new version of filter_inversion_output merged 
    - with this now prepro runs with semi-implicit model possible
    - worked on glacier gallery (OGGM-Edu app)
    - working on my PhD-Concept presentation

- Julia:
    - concerning the equlibrium runs, we will concentrate on the Alp for now (because of the past tidewater problem)

- Fabien:
    - overhaul of OGGM-MB is happening! Big changes incomming
    - OGGM - IGM link prototype
    - GLAMBIE workshop yesterday: https://glambie.org/workshop-1/ 
    - Lily is working on GlacierMiP 3 in Zürich
    - \> 300 applicants for the Pakistan training
    - Paper from Regine is finally out: https://doi.org/10.1017/jog.2023.1

- Jan
    - Working on code to be mergeable into the OGGM master

- Samar
    - Still doing some test runs in HMA sub-domains with CISM, before GlacierMIP3 submissions
    - OGGM-Karakoram paper is with editor after reviews - likely revisions coming soon (hopefully not rejection)

- Lizz (+ Molly)
    - Intercomparison: we have old runoff projections from Erik, starting in 2020...planning new ones?
    - Molly running multi-GCM projections for La Paz glacier runoff
    - Modifying precipitation (move mean) directly is difficult - should we modify during the bias correction?
        - Modify the reference climate, and/or modify the precip scaling factor (multiplicative change is more common than additive anyway for this application)

### Group Agenda Points

- optimise OGGM runs on cluster (discussion)
    - trivial solution: batch of 100 or 1000 glaciers instead of RGI regions. Easy to implement, only drawback is that aggregation back into RGI region files happens after the run (but is trivial using xarray).
    - restart runs: harder solution. Having a queue system which checks when a previous run is done and starts again (like with WRF). This needs Timo's help.
