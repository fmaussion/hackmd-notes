# OGGM Open Meeting Notes

About the format:
- **Flash updates**: quick round of short updates (~2 minutes), request of additional agenda items for longer discussions
- **Group agenda points**: longer, open discussion points of the day. Could be something that needs input from all participants, a discussion about model choices, or a prepared presentation from one of the members. Note that **our goal is to keep "Flash updates" + "Open agenda" under one hour** in order to keep a dynamic meeting.
- **Specific discussion:** more technical items that may not be of interest to everyone (e.g. about a specific problem, master thesis, etc.). These will take place after the official part.
- **Action items**: what needs to be done after the meeting and by who
- **Move to next meeting**: items that couldn't be discussed this time

## OGGM-Edu roadmap call: 2019-10-04

- Fabien Maussion / University of Innsbruck 
- Lizz Ultee / MIT
- Zora Schirmeister / University of Innsbruck
- Patrick 
- Daniel

### Updates

- retour Peru workshop Lizz
    - Spanish notebooks: https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia
    - Recommendation for OGGM-Edu: more guidance on OGGM-Edu website on how to start a repo and add helper functions.
- apps Zora:
    - Update on the new glacier explorer app -> made great progress with the new data, but the app needs some re-arrangement in screen
    - The other app needs filling
- apps Patrick
    - showed the app with new tabs serving various purposes (e.g. advanced mode, advanced plots). Main change is the time-series plots (called "logger plots") which are allowing to see changes in volume. The app is great and almost reading to be served. Performance is going to be a key issue for online use.
- retour development process Daniel (last two notebooks) and associated questions
    - three notebooks developped: temperature-index models, mass-balance, glacier advance and retreat
    - noticed difficulties in deciding what to do next, and overlap with OGGM tutorial notebooks 

### Agenda

General discussion about state and fate of OGGM-Edu. Mainly we are happy with the state of the project:
- **the apps** are uncontroversial and can continue development. The technical issue will be how to serve them online. For local application, either an executable or, better, a container based workflow
- there is work to do on the documentation of the project. What do we try to achieve? Who is the main audience? Once we have sorted out these questions the future work is going to be easier.
- we discussed the possibility to simplify the modelling workflow with dedicated, more specialized objects which are easier to work with and build upon. It remains open whether this is a good idea or not... 

### Specific action items 

- use notebook 7 from Lizz' class and translate it back in OGGM-Edu
- continue app development and facilitate deployment (key actor here: Timo + ourselves for the local deploy)
- brainstorm about a new "OGGM-Edu" with simpler objects and simpler workflows

### Flash updates

- Fabien
    - wrote a 3 pages "pre-proposal" with Ben for a "Sustainable software development" call at DFG - if succesful (unlikely) we'll have a post-doc salary for two years
    - worked on long overdue maintenance PRs: https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed (discovered quite a bad bug in OGGM with numpy 1.17)
    - also played around again with "cloud-ready" containers. e.g. https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/reproducible-binder-environments-with-repo2docker-dockerhub-and-nbgitpuller/1823 
    - https://twitter.com/LizzUltee/status/1154350500315316226
- Jenna:
    - Question about WD on https://hub.oggm.org: `/home/jovyan/`  
    - Model intercomparison OGGM - Bicycles
    - INQUA conference: talk on progress 
- Patrick:
    - App update: put on Binder? -> YES
    - Technicalities -> on chat
- Moritz:
    - finished the equilibrium runs with the VAS model.
    - started to look into linearity of the VAS model.
- Matthias
    - tested a possible precipitation gradient but probably reject the idea
- Matteo:
    - Analyzed the feature importance (i.e. what variables are important)
    - mass-balance above point, slope, are most important to explain thickness
- Anouk:
    - Sensitivity to initial conditions
    - Still in Utrecht 
    - CESM data mess: OGGM doesn't allow for time before Julian day 1. You can create such a climate file. However when using it as forcing you get an error. 
- Timo:
    - Still problems with Bokeh - ended up working without explanation!

### Agenda

- What statistical measures do you use to compare two (or more) time series? In particular comparing observed glacier length change with modeled one. (Matthias)
    - OGGM small funcs in [utils](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/blob/2058f993a56403d14bfba05096c3ca367e395e65/oggm/utils/_funcs.py#L298-L328) can be extended!
    - Idea: moving (rolling) statistics (rmsd / r2 / etc as timeseries)
    - Statistics in atmospheric sciences book
- Question on the flowlines from Jenna 
    - How to start from spin-up: look on the docs and ask on slack
- Discuss the results of the ACF and PSD analysis of the modeled VAS glacier length changes (Moritz).
    - PSD of flowline model shows a low pass behaviour (constant power for frequencies above 0.05/year). PSD of VAS model decreases constantly on the logarithmic scale (energy cascade, low pass filter?)
    - The VAS model shows less auto correlation at shorter lag times (< 200 years) than the flowline model, indicating more high frequency variability.
    - ToDo's: Compute ACF and PSD for climate signal, to better relate the forcing to the output. Additionally, get rid of spinup period for both analysis.
    
- Matteo plots
    - Showed how the volume changes between different training samples: 1% deviation
    - Showed how the score changes with different training samples: weird values for some runs: maybe some glaciers are completly left out?
    - Feature importance seems reasonable.
    - TODOS: 
        - Leave one glacier out from the training sample
        - Check how random is sklearn cross validation to find out how come some scores are much lower
        - Run oggm ice thickness for one glacier and compare it with the machine learning model.
- Anouk plot:
    - nice to see that glaciers end up at the correct volume
    - still questions about why it takes so long to merge together
    - TODO: investigations as to which glaciers are responsible


### Action items

- Rediscuss with Matthias about gradient and re-calibration 
- Long term CESM data on Github (Issue #818)

### Move to next meeting


## 2019-07-24 call

Hello and welcome to the team meeting!

### Participants 

Please sign in below so we know who was here:

Name / Institution / @GitHub handle

### Flash updates

- Fabien
    - gave a talk at IUGG 2019: https://fabienmaussion.info/2019/07/24/IUGG2019
    - a lot of feedback from the conference: OGGM highly visible, but concrete adoption (i.e. doing stuff with the model or develop) still slow. Hints of change with new users recently
    - Lizz using OGGM-Edu for a 1-week lecture in Peru: https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia. We set-up a dedicated JupyterHub for the class.
- Matteo:
    - Update about running the machine learning model for all the glaciers in the Alps
    - Do you know [nteract Data Explorer](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/packages/data-explorer)
- Julia:
    - Experiments with real world glaciers
    - link to TC discussion: https://www.the-cryosphere-discuss.net/tc-2019-68
- Matthias:
    - PR about merging glacier done: https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/pull/827
- Zora:
    - working with Patrick about the app
    - problems with the Bokeh server on edu.oggm.org: https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-edu/issues/66
    - we need a concept for the bokeh applications in Bremen
- Moritz:
    - Further work on the equilibrium runs, comparing the volume/area scaling model with the flowline mode
    - Made progress about spectral analysis: nice plots

### Agenda

- Format of these calls
    - Fabien explained it but need for some explanation text maybe
- Twitter
- thoughts on a PolynomialProfilemMassBalance model?
    - need for more realisic MB profiles
    - Please open a point on github
    - diverged to having a PeriodicMassBalanceModel
    - diverged to PeriodicMassBalanceScenario
- Need for discussion about Julia's revisions
    - Matthias, Julia and Fabien had a longer conversation about how to deal with the reviews


### Action items

- talk to Timo about bokeh when back from holiday
- Twitter contributor meeting next week
- Preformance problems about Hackmd integration in website: not much we can do here

### Move to next meeting

- Push for JupyterHub in the upcoming cluster in Bremen
- Matteo: discussion about the score
- RGI group

## 2019-07-03 call
