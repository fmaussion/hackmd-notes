https://www.iarpccollaborations.org/members/documents/16600
    - The link above requires an account, but there was a CRYOLIST email and this: https://www.iarpccollaborations.org/events/index.html 
    - Fabi recommends IARPC online talks as a valuable resource.


### 31.03.2020

- Fabi reports from department weekly meetings:
    - All ACINN employees are well - no corona case we know of except one student who got sick while or before travelling to sweden and who was quarantined there and is now healthy again
    - Changes in ACINN members:
        - Stefano Serafin will take a new position in Vienna (where his familiy lives). His project will remain in IBK (PhD students Maria Siller and Matthias Göbel). His 50% position as TEAMx coordinator will be given to Helen Ward 
        - Manuela Lehner leaves her "Rotationsstelle" and starts her own project. Her position will not be opened yet because of the situation, but it is annoying 
        - New HPC senior scientist position: same here, it is on hold as long as the situation remains uncertain
        - Lindsey *should* be able to start April 1st at 50%. We will know for sure today
    - Zeitschrift für Polarforschung: no paper copy necessary, switch to digital only 
    - New university rules: all travels are forbidden until end of June. This has strong consequences for us (especially fieldwork) and we will attempt to get exceptions (e.g. HEF work)
- Nikolina reports that her PRACE proposal got funded: 
    - A LOT of computational resources available on [Piz Daint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piz_Daint_(supercomputer)) GPU HPC 
    - start April 1st: simulations will start soon
    - Nikolina will report about the planned simulations next week
- Zora presented her Master Thesis concept. Thanks Zora!

### 24.03.2020

First meeting via Zoom - 15 participants!! Thanks all for joining in and looking forward for the next one!

- Technical issues: I made a mistake by planing the meeting (10pm instead of 10am): I'll do better next time. I think that zoom worked well, but I noticed that the sound quality of Elisabeth' and Li Fei's microphone was bad. Apparently my own microphone was not loud enough either. If you have a chance to use another microphone next time, try it! 
- We did a short round of updates - nice to see that everyone is safe, but some of us are hit a bit harder than others. Nikolina is in quarantine in Croatia and experienced a big earthquake, Marlis is in Italy where the situation is dramatic, and Li Fei was tested for a second time (!) after a person had tested positive in his dormitory. Everybody is healthy though - stay strong! And do not worry about prductivity right now - there are more important things.
- If you would like to get stuff from the office (PC, screen, keyboard) - please let me know. I would be more than happy to take my car and bring this to you.
- Regarding the plants: we could also get organized. Yesterday Conni and I went to the office and watered the plants of the ACINN kitchen, our offices, Wolfi's office, Anna/Annelies/Matthias/LiFei office, and I checked on Elisabeth plants but they were watered already. Next time I'll go to the office I'll let you know beforehand so you can tell me if the plants need water.
- Zoom: ACINN has two pro accounts which allow to have bigger meetings. If you want to use them, please write to me and I'll send you the credentials. As I showed, the important bit is to schedule your meetings in advance so that no conflict arises (as I've had to deal with today...)
- Nice presentation from Rainer about his recent work on N Greenland ice cliffs! Next week, Zora will talk about CORDEX data in the Peruvian Andes
- I'll anounce the next meeting in a separate email.


### 03.03.2020

### 25.02.2020

Krapfen meeting ;-) 

## 2020/02/17 

- A new team member: Li Fei (Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Beijing) joins us for the last year of his PhD thanks to a grant from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
- OGGM is part of a H2020 proposal that was submitted last week - the topic is "Paris Agreement Overshooting – Reversibility, Climate Impacts and Adaptation Needs"

    - Research network connecting station providers (including our Hintereisferner)
    - Strict rule about open data
    - Already one application for next year from a group of scientists who want to count beetles

    - 2 Meetings in London: intensification of precip extremes - and process understanding. Workshop about state of the art (keynotes) and indentification of knowledge gaps. 
    - Also some discussions about the physical processes and how to describe precip changes VS temp changes -> which temp variable to use?
- Marlis Q about ERA5's quality?
    - evaluation of ERA5 temp in the Alps doesn't look good - she will show some results in a next meeting
    - Fabien mentions that we are investigating ERA5 in the Peru project
- Johannes
    - some recent advances delaying the paper - long discussions about boundary conditions at the top. New experiments necessary, but no fundamental changes in the paper

    - We have some budget for hiring a student. Please send me your proposals before Feb 19th
- Science update:
    - Fabi talked shortly about his recent play time with a simple calving parameterisation in OGGM. 


## 2020/02/04

- it's semester break, yay!
- update department meeting and budget
    - the requests we made as ICU group (a CNR4 for hintereisferner and a logger for Peru) were accepted, or rather we will get some leftovers from i-Box stations
    - comparing our wishes (a few thousand Euros) to the costs of [i-Box](https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/research/atmospheric-dynamics/projects/innsbruck-box-i-box.html.en) and [IAO](https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/research/atmospheric-physics-and-chemistry/projects/hrsm-iao.html.en) (about 15-20kE each) makes me think that we should ask for more money next time.
- report IASC Obergurgl meeting
    - Mike, Fabien and David Rounce went to the [IASC Workshop](Workshop on the Dynamics and Mass Budget of Arctic Glaciers) last week. It was super well organised (thanks to Mike!) and very interesting.
- update PRACE proposal (Nikolina - not in town this week)
    - Nikolina's PRACE proposal was reviewed and "conditionally accepted". Let's cross fingers and hope for a true acceptance soon.
- **Scientific presentation:** David Rounce on his recent work with [PyGEM](https://github.com/drounce/PyGEM) ([paper 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00331/full) and [paper 2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/quantifying-parameter-uncertainty-in-a-largescale-glacier-evolution-model-using-bayesian-inference-application-to-high-mountain-asia/61D8956E9A6C27CC1A5AEBFCDADC0432)). Thanks Dave!


## 2020/01/21

- Lindsey has been offered the professorship position, and will now be in negociations with Mathias about the terms of the QV, etc.
- ACINN budget 2020: do we have large-ish instruments we'd like to buy with the money? Here are some suggestions from our group.
    - Shallap AWS (Peru): CR1000X (~2500E) + material (~500E). 
    -  CNR4 Radiometer at Station Hintereis (current one is 10 yrs old). Price estimate?
    - Cosmic ray neutron probe to measure SWE. Price estimate? Maybe ideas to split the costs between ACINN and other funding?
- AGM Milano (deadline Feb 5tg): Matthias is going!
- EGU: Anna submitted abstract last minute as well. We have to find a way to finance this.
- we had a quick chat about data storage: Peru drive might still be located in Geography? Don't we want to store laser data at ACINN as well? Fabi will check these things.
- **Scientific presentation**: Cornelia Zauner presented results from her master thesis: her WRF simulations in Peru look very promising!


## 2020/01/14

- short update institute's meeting (Fabi)
    - There are new workplace security guidelines, and ACINN has a team responsible for communication (Rainer is on it with Friedl and Martin). You've all become the email on Wednesday as well
    - Master degree: there has been an unusual number of applicants (7) from the Global South (Pakistan, Mozambique...). Georg Mayr accepted about half the applications, which means that diversity will increase at ACINN (finally!)
    - There is a new "Pre-Doc-Stipendium" from ÖAW:  https://stipendien.oeaw.ac.at/stipendien/dimitrov/ 
    - **Budget**: very similar to last year, with about EUR 60'000 available for investitions. We (the ICU group) should discuss our propositions.
 - short update RGI meeting (Matthias)
    - Fabi and Matthias went to Zürich for RGI meeting with "RGI working group steering committee" 
    - Time plan for 2020 targetting an RGI V7 release by end 2020
    - RGI-TOPO dataset to be released soon
- Rainer was by the "Schnee Semmelnar" to present the HEF project - good feedback, maybe some people are interested in new experiments?
- Johannes gave a presentation about his latest paper (almost finished!) - cherry on the cake was a discussion about the philosophy of validating models and Karl Popper.

## 2019/11/19

Thanks all for the nice meeting today!

### Agenda

- **Hearings glaciology**
    - the program for the 27th is now online: https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/news/2019/tenure-track-position-glaciology-2019.html.en . You are encouraged to come for the presentations! You can send me your comments via mail (I will check them regularly during the day and before the decision process) or you can speak to me.
    - there is an institute visit planned for the two "external" candidates on Tuesday 26. As discussed, any person in ICU is welcome to meet the candidates in an informal setting in the meeting room. You will meet **Johannes Fürst at 16:30** and **Andrew Tedstone at 17:00** (maybe a couple of minutes later). As discussed today: this meeting is also important for the candidates: our aim is to help them to know the group and prepare for the interviews accordingly. Get ready for questions from their side as well!
- **DP News**: we have a doctoral programme (yes we do: https://www.uibk.ac.at/alpinerraum/dps/dp-mountainclimate/) and things are going well! We had a recent evaluation by the university and it was very positive. Stay tuned for future events
- **Hearings Rectorate**: Elisaeth went to the hearings for the rectorate team and brought up the question of the "Kettenvertrag" to one of the candidates. She was kind of happy with the answer but of course we don't know who is going to be selected in the end.
- **IGS membership and Austrian correspondent**: thanks for the info and the mail Elisabeth! She will continue to be correspondent until at least the end of her contract, but then someone should take over - please consider it.

## 2019/10/01

Many people present! We talked about:
- Fabien taking over as interim group head
- The new meeting time, and how we want to finish on time. We failed to start on time today because of a queue at the coffee machine. It was aknowledged that it is likely that there will always be a queue at the coffee machine before our group meetings. **Therefore, the new meeting time for coffee drinkers is now set to 10h10.**
- the student excursion, which for optimisation reasons was split in two groups (Rainer at Kesselwandferner, Stephan at Langenferner). It's better for the students and to get the job done (here the annual "Abschlussbegehung"). The only entity complaining is the University, which has to pay for two mountain guides.
- Elisabeth reminded us to wish ourselves a "happy new glaciological year"
- Rainer's participation at the INTERACT meeting.
- the teaching duties of our group. Most notable changes:
    - Nikolina now teaches "Numerical Modeling of Weather and Climate"
    - Kristin teaches "Climate Change: Past, Present and Future"  as a new faculty-wide bachelor level lecture (together with Gina) and "Detecting, understanding and communicating climate change" as university-wide master level lecture (together with Gina, Kurt and Wolfi)
    - Rainer took over the Literature seminar (currently early on Thursdays). @Rainer, please inform us about the upcoming papers
- Fabien reported about the recent field work in Peru. It all went very well! (He will try to write a blog post about it soon).
